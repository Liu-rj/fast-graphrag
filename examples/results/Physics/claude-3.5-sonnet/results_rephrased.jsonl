The authors compare their calculations with existing observational lower limits to obtain these constraints. \n\nThe study assumes the canonical scenario for structure formation and maximizes black hole accretion and merging rates to obtain robust constraints on w and its lookback time derivative wa. The results provide independent constraints that are complementary to those obtained from other cosmological probes like supernovae, cosmic microwave background, and baryonic acoustic oscillations.\n\nImportantly, while previous constraints left the time evolution of wa highly unconstrained, this study's approach using black hole abundance mainly provides upper limits on wa that only weakly depend on w0. When combined with existing constraints, these results significantly restrict the allowed region in DDE parameter space, particularly disfavoring models with -1.2 ≤ w0 ≤ -1 and positive redshift evolution (wa > 0.8), which corresponds to quintom DDE models where w crosses -1 starting from larger values.", "duration": 26.67, "token_count": 7232, "api_calls": 1, "gt_answer": "N/A"}
