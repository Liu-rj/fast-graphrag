Key challenges include observational inconsistencies due to bulk effects altering the Hubble-energy density relationship, requiring unrealistic fine-tuning to stabilize the extra dimension's radius, and implications for causality in theories where extra-dimensional volume determines gravitational coupling. While most configurations conflict with cosmological constraints (e.g., nucleosynthesis, structure formation), specific stress-energy tensor configurations in the bulk can reproduce normal FRW cosmology.
